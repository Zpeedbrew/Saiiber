# Developer Notes
$\color{blue}{Uses clang-format with Google formatting. All pull requests must comply with these formatting requirements.}$	

- Logger should log to the Dolphin console if you turn off "Enable MMU" in the advanced settings.
- sd directory contains the virtual SD card data.
- Libraries required are all installed with pacman and listed in the Makefile
- Makefile output was changed to output a "boot.dol/elf" in the sd/apps/saiiber directory

$\color{blue}{
The virtual sd card on Dolphin can convert the folder into a file for use in the emulator. I wanted the sd directory to reflect the final product as it would be installed by any user.}$
