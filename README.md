# Compiling:

- Install devkitPPC (if you are on linux install wii-dev with dkp-pacman)
- Install the dependenices in the dependencies.txt file
- Compile it using make
- launch the .elf file dolphin

# Developer Notes
Uses clang-format with Google formatting. All pull requests must comply with these formatting requirements. 

- Logger should log to the Dolphin console if you turn off "Enable MMU" in the advanced settings.
- sd directory contains the virtual SD card data.
- Libraries required are all installed with pacman and listed in the Makefile
- Makefile output was changed to output a "boot.dol/elf" in the sd/apps/saiiber directory

The virtual sd card on Dolphin can convert the folder into a file for use in the emulator. I wanted the sd directory to reflect the final product as it would be installed by any user.
